**Project Overview:**
The Neural Network Visualization project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for
visualizing neural networks.This project utilizes various technologies such as ZK, JavaScript, and D3.js for the frontend visualization,
along with Spring Core, Hibernate, and Maven for backend functionalities.

**Project Features:**

* Dynamic Network Graph: The application allows users to input parameters such as input layer height, hidden layer count, and output layer height. Based on these parameters, the neural network graph is dynamically generated and visualized on the frontend.
* Interactive UI: Users can interact with the application through intuitive UI elements such as input fields and buttons  to customize the neural network structure and observe the changes in real-time.
* Scalable Architecture: The project follows a modular and scalable architecture, making it easy to extend and maintain. It leverages technologies like Spring Core and Hibernate for backend operations, ensuring robustness and scalability.

**Technologies Used:**

1. Frontend:
* ZK: ZK framework is utilized for building the frontend user interface, providing rich and responsive components for a seamless user experience.
* JavaScript: JavaScript is used for client-side scripting to handle dynamic interactions and data manipulation.
* D3.js: D3.js is employed for generating interactive and dynamic visualizations of the neural network graph.

2. Backend:
* Spring Core: Spring Core is utilized for dependency injection and managing the application's core functionality, promoting modular design and easy integration with other Spring modules.
* Hibernate: Hibernate ORM framework is employed for object-relational mapping, facilitating database operations and ensuring data persistence.
* Maven: Maven is used as the project management tool for managing dependencies, building, and deploying the application, enhancing project scalability and maintainability.

* Setup Instructions:
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository from [https://github.com/bienheureuseuwineza/NeuralNetworksGraph].
Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and Apache Maven on your system if not already installed.
Navigate to the project directory and run mvn clean install to build the project.
Deploy the generated WAR file to a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat.
Access the application through the provided URL and start visualizing neural networks!
